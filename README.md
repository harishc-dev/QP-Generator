## 📖 How It Works

### 1. **Upload Question Bank**
- Navigate to **Upload** section
- Drag-and-drop `.docx` files containing questions
- Files must follow the format:
  ```
  Chapter: 1
  I          (MCQ section)
  1. Question text here?
  Ans: Answer text here
  
  II         (Assertion section)
  2. Another question?
  Ans: Answer here
  ```
- Questions marked with `[True]` get priority in selection

### 2. **Generate Paper**
- Go to **Generate** section
- Each chapter shows 6 question type selectors
- Use `+` / `-` buttons to choose question count
- Select "Include answers in output" if needed
- Click **Generate Paper Preview** to see the paper
- Click **Export to DOCX** to save

### 3. **View Generated Papers**
